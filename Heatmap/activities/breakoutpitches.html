Each team member is assigned to a different breakout room during the live lecture. In their breakout room, students present their pitches. The presentation is followed by a discussion and a peer review by their fellow students to provide feedback.</p>

          <!-- <h5 class="marginbottom">1. Implementation</h5> -->
          <p>1. Before class, students are asked to prepare a 5-10 minute pitch and a short, accompanying presentation. If the presentation is made as a part of a team, they need to make sure that all team members are comfortable giving the pitch and answering questions about it. The students should cover the project context, talk about their key findings and introduce their initial solution in their presentation.</p>
          <p>2. All team members are assigned to a different breakout room, where they take turns giving pitches. The teacher or other course staff divide the students into the breakout rooms in beforehand, making sure that the same pitch is not given twice in the same room (i.e. teammates are in different breakout rooms). The teacher can visit the students' pitches to give feedback, but the focus is on peer learning.</p>
          <p>3. Each student is given 10 minutes to pitch and 10 minutes for questions and feedback from other students. Students are asked to appoint someone from their breakout room to time the pitches. Keeping the pitches short is part of the challenge! Rooms of 4-5 students are ideal (time spent in class is approx. 2h with this size) </p>
          <p>4. Teams now have feedback on their project from 3-5 different groups of people (depending on the size of the team - e.g. in a 4 person team, 4 students have each pitched the solution in a different breakout room). Students discuss the findings and feedback with their team and make a plan for incorporating them to the project before the final presentation and report.</p>
          <p>5. The assignment is peer-evaluated, and a link to a feedback / evaluation form is shared with the students at the beginning of the class. The evaluation should be done in real-time, during the class hours, so it's good to reserve about 5 mins after each pitch for the students to give their written feedback and do the evaluation.</p>
          <p class="headline2">Facilitation Notes</p>
          <!-- <h5 class="marginbottom">2. Facilitation Notes</h5> -->
          <p class="marginbottom">Time management with the students can be a challenge. The teacher should emphasise the need to stick to the allocated time so that everyone has a chance to give their pitch. The students should also be given clear instructions for the activity in beforehand so they can prepare adequately. Peer evaluation needs to be made simple and clear. </p>
