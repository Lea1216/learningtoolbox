      <!-- <h1 class="activity">Free Component</h1> -->
      <p class="activity">Within this activity students can present to their classmates anything they wish and can deliver some content on a topic of choice. Examples of those content can be a theatherical performance or production and presentation of media contents on a variety of topics. During the presentation the students need to make clear that they were able to develop an articulated idea/concept of their choice and communicate it to an audience. Monitoring for  educators includes enforcing the deadline for the students to submit their contributions, ensuring that students understand the rules and clarify doubts about allowed contents. The aim of the activity is to stimulatie of out-of-the-box thinking in the context of academic work. This is completely independent from other academic activities and can be combined with them using standard academic practices, e.g., as a component of course student evaluation.</p>

          <p>1.	Communicate to the students the objectives and rules of engagement of the activity.</p>
          <p>2. Students are asked to prepare some content on a topic of choice.</p>
          <p>3.	Educators needs to monitor that deadline is kept and need to make sure that students understood what they have to deliver.</p>
          <p>4.	Students pitch their topic of choice.</p>
          <p>5.	Educators grade the performance and provide a detailed report on their grades.</p>
          <p class="headline2">Facilitation Notes</p>
          <!-- <h5 class="marginbottom">2. Facilitation Notes</h5> -->
          <p>A significant percentage of students tend to be suspicious about what is to be gained with this kind of activity. This often leads students to present works aiming at causing discomfort to teachers. Once duly assessed and graded, such works tend to be very effective in demonstrating the objectives of the activity. Often students want a detailed report on their grades. This must be provided as detailed as possible. Also, illustrating how the strong and weak points of the work can affect the academic performance is appreciated by the students. </p>
